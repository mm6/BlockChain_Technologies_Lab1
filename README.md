## Spring 2021 Blockchain Technologies Lab 1                             
### Carnegie Mellon University                  
### Due: Sunday, March 28, 11:59 PM Doha Time

**Learning Objectives:** In this lab the student will set up an Ethereum
development environment (using Truffle and Ganache) and deploy three smart
contracts to an Ethereum test blockchain. The smart contracts will be
written in the Solidity programming language.

We will experiment with running "transactions". Transactions cause state
changes, cost ether (for using gas), and may only return responses at a later time.

We will also run "calls". Calls do not change state on the blockchain and
cost nothing to run (no gas). They are processed immediately and provide
an immediate return value.

We will review the various views of the blockchain that Ganache provides.

Solidity event generation and a testing framework are also introduced and the student will modify an existing contract.

The contracts themselves will be studied in detail at a later date. For
now, we want to get some experience deploying and interacting with the
Solidity code and the environment provided by client side Truffle and
server side Ganache.

## Part 2  (Modified from "Mastering Ethereum" by Antonopoulos and Wood)

1) Run ganache quick start and leave it running for the remainder of this part.
2) Create a new project directory named DBUC_Lab1_Part2 and cd into it.
3) Execute the command:

 ```

   truffle init

```

4) Examine the directory structure:

* **contracts** holds solidity source code
  * Migrations.sol is a deployment contract
* **migrations** holds javascript code for efficient redeployments
  * 1_initial_migrations.js
  * This first migration deploys the Migrations.sol contract.
* **test**
  * This directory is for writing tests in Javascript.
It typically uses the mocha framework and Chai Assertions library.
In more complex deployments, this directory structure will mirror
the directory structure required by the application.
* **truffle-config.js**

  * This Javascript file contains configuration parameters for this truffle project.

5) Create a new contract in the contracts directory. This file will be named
   Faucet.sol. The content of Faucet.sol is:

   ```
   // Solidity code Faucet.sol
   pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
   contract Faucet {
       function withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {
           require(withdraw_amount <= 100000000000000000000);
           msg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);
       }
       function() external payable {}
   }
   ```
6) Create a new migration file in the migrations directory. Do
   not remove the initial migration 1_initial_migration.js.
   This new file will be named 2_deploy_migration.js.
   This file will contain a migration script to deploy Faucet.sol.
   The content of 2_deploy_migrations.js is:
   ```

   // Javascript in 2_deploy_migrations.js to deploy Faucet.sol
   var Faucet = artifacts.require("./Faucet.sol");
   module.exports = function(deployer) {
     deployer.deploy(Faucet);
   };

   ```

7) To create a package.json file, run the following command
   from within the project directory:

 ```
   npm init
 ```

   Take the suggested defaults.

8) From the project directory, run the command

 ```

  npm install dotenv truffle-wallet-provider ethereumjs-wallet

 ```
   This creates a node_modules directory. Ignore the warnings.

9) To compile and deploy the two contracts (Migrations.sol and Faucet.sol)
   to the blockchain (represented by Ganache), make sure that Ganache is running
   and execute the command:

 ```
   truffle migrate --reset
 ```

10) To interact with the deployed contract and accounts, use the truffle console.

    a. From the command line, execute the following commands:

    ```
    truffle console
    ```

    b. Access the contract with an asynchronous request. Use a
       callback function and a promise. The callback
       function is defined within the "then" clause.
       Execute the following command within the truffle console.

      ```
      Faucet.deployed().then(function(x){ myApp = x; });
      ```

      The response should be 'undefined'.

    c. To view the response enter the name myApp.

 ```
      myApp

  ```
  d. To get access to a web3 object, enter three lines of Javascript.
       The first two will return 'undefined'.

 ```

      var Web3 = require('web3');
      var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://127.0.0.1:7545'));
      web3.isConnected() // should return true if all three lines worked.

```

   e. Get the balance on the contract.

 ```
      contractBalance = web3.eth.getBalance(Faucet.address).toNumber()
 ```

   f. View the account addresses available on Ganache:

 ```
      web3.eth.accounts
 ```

   g. View the first address. This address is our default address provided
      by Ganache. We are in possession of its private key. Ganache has
      provided this account with 100 eth (but only usable on Ganache).

  ```
      web3.eth.accounts[0]
  ```

   h. View the contract address.

  ```
      Faucet.address
  ```

   i. Using web3, transfer eth from the first account to the contract.
      The value returned is the transaction hash. Check the logs in Ganache.

  ```
      web3.eth.sendTransaction({from:web3.eth.accounts[0],to:Faucet.address,value:web3.toWei(0.5, 'ether')})

  ```

   j. Check that the balance on the contract is higher than before.

  ```
      web3.eth.getBalance(Faucet.address).toNumber();
  ```

   k. Withdraw some ether from the contract and deposit to account[0]. This returns 'undefined'.

  ```
      Faucet.deployed().then(instance => {receipt = instance.withdraw(web3.toWei(0.1,'ether'))});
  ```

   l. But we can examine the returned receipt.

```
      receipt
```
   m. Check the balance on account[0]. Should be 99591514500000000000.

  ```
      web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[0]).toNumber();
  ```

   n. To exit the truffle console hit control d.

   ```
   truffle(ganache)>ctrl+d

   ```

  :checkered_flag:**11) At this point, take three screenshots of Ganache. Take a screenshot of your Ganache Accounts, Blocks, and Transactions. Place these in a single Word or PDF document named Lab1Part2.doc or Lab1Part2.pdf. **


## Part 3  (Modified from "Mastering Ethereum" by Antonopoulos and Wood)

1) Create a new project directory named DBUC_Lab1_Part3 and cd into it.

2) Execute the command:

   ```
   truffle init

   ```
3) Run a new instance of ganache. Configure Ganache as follows:

   Select "new workspace".

   Select "add project".

   Choose the file "truffle-config.js" in your "DBUC_Lab1_Part3" project directory.

   Provide the workspace with an appropriate name.

   Save the workspace.

   On the server side (Ganache) you should now be able to view the following tabs:
   Accounts, Blocks, Transactions, Contracts, Events, and Logs. These are all now
   associated with your project.

4) Create a new contract in the contracts directory and name it Faucet.sol.

5) [Click here to see your Faucet.sol code.](../../blob/master/Faucet.sol)

6) Use Part 2 as a guide and deploy this new contract to Ganache.
      That is, repeat the following steps from Part 2: Step 6, 7,
      8, 9 and Step 10a to 10d - while replacing myApp with myFaucet
      in Step 10.

7) Send a total of 2 ether to the contract with these two commands:

 ```
      myFaucet.send(web3.toWei(1,"ether")).then(res => { console.log(res.logs[0].event)})

 ```    
 ```
      myFaucet.send(web3.toWei(1,"ether")).then(res => { console.log(res.logs[0].event, res.logs[0].args)})

 ```

 8) Send a "withdraw" transaction to the contract. This will be a request to withdraw 2 eth.

     In your own words, describe what happens on the client.

     In your own words, describe the most recent activities on the Ganache Logs user interface.

 9)  Send a single request to withdraw 0.1 eth from the contract.

     Show the receipt that is returned from this request.

10)  Make enough withdrawals from the contract so that it (the contract) runs out of eth. We are interested in the first request that causes the following "require" statement to fail:

     require((address(this)).balance >= withdraw_amount,"Balance too small for this withdrawal");

     Force this "require" to fail and show the logs where this error is mentioned. The logs are found on the Ganache user interface.

11)  Show a screenshot showing the balance and storage associated with your Faucet contract. The balance and storage associated with a contract  are found on the Ganache user interface.

12)  Show a screenshot showing the transactions and events that are associated
     with your Faucet contract. The transactions and events associated with a contract are found on the Ganache user interface.

Part 3 Submission summary:

     Question 8 Two paragraphs

     Question 10 copy and paste of partial log file
     Question 11 screenshot
     Question 12 screenshot

:checkered_flag:**13)Place your submissions in a single Word or PDF document named
         Lab1Part3.doc or Lab1Part3.pdf.**

## Part 4 Using a Truffle box with MetaCoin.sol, ConvertLib.sol and the testing framework  

1) Create a new project directory named DBUC_Lab1_Part4 and cd into it.

2) Execute the command:

```
   truffle unbox metacoin

```

3) Edit the file truffle-config.js and remove most comment symbols so that
   the file appears as shown:

```
module.exports = {
  // Uncommenting the defaults below
  // provides for an easier quick-start with Ganache.
  // You can also follow this format for other networks;
  // see <http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration>
  // for more details on how to specify configuration options!
  //
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*"
    },
    test: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*"
    }
  }
};

```

4) Run a new instance of ganache and configure Ganache as before:

         Select "new workspace".

         Select "add project".

         Choose the file "truffle-config.js" in your "DBUC_Lab1_Part4" project directory.

         Provide the workspace with an appropriate name.

         Save the workspace.

5) Notice that you have three contracts in the contracts subdirectory. One
   of these is the migration contract and the other two are ConvertLib.sol	and
   MetaCoin.sol.

6) Study MetaCoin.sol and ConvertLib.sol and then run the following commands in order.
Note that most of these commands are 'calls' and cost no gas. The transaction sendCoin,
however, costs gas and generates a receipt. Make a copy of this receipt for submission.

```
            truffle migrate --reset
            truffle console  

            metaCoinInstance = await MetaCoin.deployed()

            balance = await metaCoinInstance.getBalance.call(accounts[0])

            balance

            balance.toNumber()

            metaCoinBalance = (await metaCoinInstance.getBalance.call(accounts[0])).toNumber()

            metaCoinBalance

            metaCoinEthBalance = (await metaCoinInstance.getBalanceInEth.call(accounts[0])).toNumber()

            metaCoinEthBalance

            accountOne = accounts[0]

            accountTwo = accounts[1]

            accountOneStartingBalance = (await metaCoinInstance.getBalance.call(accountOne)).toNumber()

            accountOneStartingBalance

            accountTwoStartingBalance = (await metaCoinInstance.getBalance.call(accountTwo)).toNumber()
            accountTwoStartingBalance

            amount = 10
            metaCoinInstance.sendCoin(accountTwo, amount, { from: accountOne })

            accountOneEndingBalance = (await metaCoinInstance.getBalance.call(accountOne)).toNumber()

            accountOneEndingBalance

            accountTwoEndingBalance = (await metaCoinInstance.getBalance.call(accountTwo)).toNumber()
            accountTwoEndingBalance

```    
7) Exit the console (ctrl-D) and examine the directory named test. It contains a file named
metacoin.js that is provided as part of the truffle box. Look over the javascript code and
compare it with the code we entered above in the console.

8) From the project directory, execute the test code by running:

 ```
truffle tests

 ```
9) Take a screenshot of the command line output.

10) Add a new Event to the MetaCoin contract. This event will be fired when
sendCoin is called with an inappropriate transfer of funds. You need to
submit three items:

    a) Submit a copy of your new MetaCoin.sol contract - include your name in the
    program comments.

    b) Show a screenshot of your command line that is testing this event. That
    is, show an example of making a call where the sender has insufficient funds.

    c) Show the transaction receipt that is returned to the caller. This transaction receipt will contain the following line:

    ```
    event: 'Insufficient_Funds'

    ```


    d) Submit a screenshot of the Ganache Events screen showing the details of the Insufficient_Funds Event.  


 11) Note that, from the project directory, you can compile your Solidity code by running:

 ```
  truffle compile

 ```

Part 4 Submission summary:

              Question 6 Submit a copy of the receipt generated by sendCoin.

              Question 9. Submit a screenshot of the command line output.

              Question 10 a. Submit a modified MetaCoin contract (including your name).

              Question 10 b. Submit a command line screenshot.

              Question 10 c. Submit a copy of the receipt showing insufficient funds.

              Question 10 d. Submit a screenshot of the Ganache Events screen showing the details of the Insufficient_Funds Event.
